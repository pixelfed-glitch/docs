## Overview

Push notifications enhance the Pixelfed experience by delivering real-time updates directly to users' devices. These notifications inform users about new followers, likes, comments, and other important interactions, keeping them engaged with their community.

## Availability

Currently, push notifications are limited to the official Pixelfed mobile applications. We plan to support web push and 3rd party applications in the future.


## Instance Approval and API Key Requirement

To enable push notifications on your Pixelfed instance, you must obtain manual approval and a unique API key from the Pixelfed team. This process helps maintain the integrity and performance of the push notification service across the network.

### Steps to Enable Push Notifications for Your Instance

4) **Configure Your Instance**: Update your instance settings to include the provided API key. Refer to the [Configuration](/configuration/configuration) docs.
