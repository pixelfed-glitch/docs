# Why Pixelfed Glitch ?

## Pixelfed Glitch is a fork of the official Pixelfed ActivityPub platform.

We aim at delivering a community-driven project with a flatter governance,
to accept more feedback and submissions from the community,
and to give better features and fixes, without breaking compatibility with upstream.

## With Pixelfed Glitch, you get :

- Built and Built-in docker images, on Github and Docker Hub 
- Better and more fine-grained semantic versioning
- A better update system following git flow, with :
  - nightly updates on `staging` branch
  - stable (latest) update on `main` branch
  - unstable (develop) updates on `develop` branch
- QoL and stability fixes
- No sudden deprecation

## Projects we would want to tackle :

- Better separation between App and API
- UI fixes / revamp
- Fixes with regression tests on database
- Long awaited features, like a better federation feed with relays
